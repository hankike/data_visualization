Aiming to make good looking graphs with Python

My goal is to make good looking data with pitching. All code is made using pybaseball data. My goal is to eventually make large combined images that can resemble a scouting report.

First goal: Work on a velocity distribution graph. Want to add more y-axis labels and a title. Then work on coloring so that my labels are not a different color.
