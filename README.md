Aiming to make good looking graphs with Python

My goal is to make good looking data with pitching. All code is made using pybaseball data. My goal is to eventually make large combined images that can resemble a scouting report.

My next goal is to reorder the pitches by number of pitches thrown in the velocity distribution graph.
